# HeartDiseaseDetection
 The scope of this project is to create a system to recognize data collection, pattern matching to calculate the accuracy of the datasets. Symptoms of the heart attack can be used as an alternative prediction more accurate diagnosis which also reduces the cost of treatment using machine learning algorithms Naïve Baye’s (NB) Algorithm (Baye’s Theorem)
